## About
I’m a Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo (FARM + Joint Statistics, Minor in Computational Mathematics) focused on shipping real systems that move revenue, eliminate time waste, and scale decision-making.

I currently work at **Fortune Foods**, the family business, where I deliberately focus my time when co-op isn’t the priority, transforming a traditional wholesale food business into a technology-driven operation — one internal tool, pipeline, and automation at a time.

## What I Do
- Design and ship end-to-end data systems
- Replace manual workflows with software
- Build internal tools that actually get used
- Translate business intuition into executable logic

## Selected Work
**Decision Support & BI Platform (Production)**  
Built and deployed a full BI and decision-support system for a UK food wholesaler:
- Automated data ingestion and validation pipelines
- Customer, sales, and regional performance analytics
- Demand forecasting and executive dashboards

**Wholesale Tech Stack Modernization**
- Internal platforms for sales and operations
- Custom e-commerce and trade workflows
- Data-driven cataloguing, labeling, and compliance tooling

**Label Translation & Automation (WIP)**
- OCR-assisted label translation workflows
- Custom dictionaries and compliance blacklists
- Early-stage product viability signals using trend data

## Stack
**Languages**  
Python, SQL, JavaScript, R

**Frameworks / Tools**  
Flask, React, Pandas, NumPy, Prophet

**Data & Infra**  
PostgreSQL, Excel, REST APIs, IFS ERP, Sage ERP

## Beyond Code
Born in London, now based in Waterloo, Canada.

Outside of work and coursework, I spend time on tennis, golf, and sabre fencing (tennis wins on logistics). I follow Formula One a little too closely, which inevitably led to sim racing and questionable financial decisions.

I also cook — mostly Chinese techniques — though I’m regularly told my Chicken & Mash holds its own. I grew up playing piano, clarinet, and saxophone; these days I mostly listen and analyze instead.
